//Usage
This tutorial is intended for educational purposes. It explains how a regular expression works by breaking down each component. You can use the regex discussed in this tutorial to validate email addresses in your web applications or any other software that requires email validation.

The regex covered in this tutorial is:

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
//Regex Breakdown
The tutorial covers the following components of the regex:

Anchors: ^ and $ are used to match the start and end of the string.
Character Classes: [a-z0-9_\.-] matches lowercase letters, digits, underscores, periods, and hyphens.
Quantifiers: + ensures that the preceding character class appears one or more times.
Grouping and Capturing: () are used to group parts of the regex and capture them for backreferences.
Escaping Special Characters: \. escapes the dot character, which is normally a wildcard in regex.
